(22) Any processing of personal data in the context of the activities of an establishment of a controller or a processor
in the Union should be carried out in accordance with this Regulation, regardless of whether the processing itself
takes place within the Union. Establishment implies the effective and real exercise of activity through stable
arrangements. The legal form of such arrangements, whether through a branch or a subsidiary with a legal
personality, is not the determining factor in that respect. (23) In order to ensure that natural persons are not deprived of the protection to which they are entitled under this
Regulation, the processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or a processor not
established in the Union should be subject to this Regulation where the processing activities are related to offering
goods or services to such data subjects irrespective of whether connected to a payment. In order to determine whether
such a controller or processor is offering goods or services to data subjects who are in the Union, it should be
ascertained whether it is apparent that the controller or processor envisages offering services to data subjects in one
or more Member States in the Union. Whereas the mere accessibility of the controller's, processor's or an
intermediary's website in the Union, of an email address or of other contact details, or the use of a language generally
used in the third country where the controller is established, is insufficient to ascertain such intention, factors such as
the use of a language or a currency generally used in one or more Member States with the possibility of ordering
goods and services in that other language, or the mentioning of customers or users who are in the Union, may make it
apparent that the controller envisages offering goods or services to data subjects in the Union. (24) The processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or processor not
established in the Union should also be subject to this Regulation when it is related to the monitoring of the behaviour
of such data subjects in so far as their behaviour takes place within the Union. In order to determine whether a
processing activity can be considered to monitor the behaviour of data subjects, it should be ascertained whether
natural persons are tracked on the internet including potential subsequent use of personal data processing techniques
which consist of profiling a natural person, particularly in order to take decisions concerning her or him or for
analysing or predicting her or his personal preferences, behaviours and attitudes. (25) Where Member State law applies by virtue of public international law, this Regulation should also apply to a
controller not established in the Union, such as in a Member State’s diplomatic mission or consular post. GDPR training, consulting and DPO outsourcing
